The writer's gratitude goes to God Almighty for His grace, blessings, and guidance
so the research with the title: \textbf{"Mimicking Between Humanoid Robot and Human Based on Real-Time Pose Estimation"} can be completed properly.

This research was compiled in order to fulfill the research field at the Department
of Computer Engineering, and was used as a requirement to complete undergraduate
education. This research can not be completed without the help of parties. Therefore,
the writer would like to give his thanks to:
